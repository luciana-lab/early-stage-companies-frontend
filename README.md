# Early Stage Companies Contributions
This is the frontend of the application that the user can view and interact with it. Please, also install the [Rails frontend](https://github.com/luciana-lab/early-stage-companies-backend) and follow the installation instruction.

This application was developed to help summarize the information and needs of companies/startups in their early stage beyond capital needs. It is inspired on [1 Million Cups](https://www.1millioncups.com/).\
1 Million Cups organized a meeting every Wednesday over 163 cities in the U.S. and 2 projects are pitched in every meeting. The community gives support, feedback, and people can help them with the project needs.\
Usage:
1. To create a project, the user needs to create an account or log in;
2. After fill up the form, the project will show up on "all projects" page and will have it own page;
3. All the project information will be displayed on the individual project page where anyone (who is logged in) can add a contribution with the need asked for.
4. The person who wrote the contribution and the project owner are the only ones who can see the contribution content and delete it. The project owner can also edit or delete the project.
